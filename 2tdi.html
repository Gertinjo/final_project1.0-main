          <h2>What are TDI Emissions?</h2>
          <p>TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engines are known for their high efficiency and performance, but they have raised concerns about emissions. Understanding the emissions from these engines is critical for both environmental protection and regulatory compliance.</p>

          <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
          <p>While TDI engines help reduce CO2 emissions, they can still produce high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to air pollution and smog. Efforts to improve emissions control have been ongoing to make TDI engines more eco-friendly.</p>
